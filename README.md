## CLASSIFICATION OF COMPLAINT NARRATIVES INTO ISSUE CATEGORIES USING LSH, NAÏVE BAYES AND ANN
#### By Aditya Joseph James and Yash Pratap Solanky

This repository has been created for the final project for the Data Mining course B565 taught by Prof.Yuzhen Ye. 

Our project aims to classify consumer complaints data based on the narrative of the complaints into issue categories. We felt it was an important problem to solve as too often we fail to hear back from companies for the complaints that we have raised. One of the possible reasons could be that the complaint is lost among thousands of complaints raised by other people too. 

We believe that text classification algorithms could help with identifying the category that the complaint narrative would belong to thus streamlining the process for companies.

We tried using several algorithms such as LSH, Naive Bayes and ANN to carry out the classification.

## Dataset used for analysis
We used the dataset from Kaggle. We were not able to upload it due to the size limitation of GitHub. The dataset can be found at the link >> https://www.kaggle.com/selener/consumer-complaint-database
